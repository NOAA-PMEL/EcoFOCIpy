History
-------

0.0.6
-----

*Release date: 2021-4-23*

If this was true semantic versioning - it would be a big bump because I broke the existing api for netcdf generation.  Now - all moored and ctd data uses same api for netcdf generation as opposed to independent objects.

Also - Added ADCP processing and analysis tool

- many more jupyter notebook examples
