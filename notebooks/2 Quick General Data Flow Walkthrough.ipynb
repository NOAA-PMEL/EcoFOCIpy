    "Data comes from FOCI investigation in one of two general manners:  \n",
    "__delayed mode__ : downloaded upon retrieval of instrumentation  \n",
    "__realtime mode__ : transmitted via serial connection or satellite uplink  \n",
    "\n",
    "Realtime has historically been:\n",
    "- ARGO (clsamerica)\n",
    "- Irridium SBD packets (often ingested via EDD/SDIG rudics systems\n",
    "- TELOS\n",
    "- as well as via direct connection to instrumentation via serial ports\n",

    "We also use the following terminalogy to describe data through various stages of processing:\n",
    "- preliminary / near real time (NRT): this is data with minimal qc and minimal metadata... used for quick looks and initial explorations\n",
    "- working: not often hosted but is an intermediary state where some qc has been applied but not completed\n",
    "- final: vetted data with major QC attributes take care of\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Data Types:\n",
    "- Profile data (CTD) at point locations. Collected usually by Cruise\n",
    "- Discrete Sampled Profile data (CTD nutrients/oxy/chlor bottles) at point locations. Collected usually by Cruise\n",
    "- Moored timeseries data at point locations.  Organized first by depth, then collected by mooring site\n",
    "- Moored profile (prawler).  TimeSeriesProfile.  Organized by mooring site.\n",
    "- Moored gridded profile (binned gridded ADCP). Organized by mooring site.\n",
    "- TrajectoryProfile (gliders). Organized by campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Synthesized Datasets:\n",
    "- merged continuous profile data (CTD - commonly binned to 1m) with discrete data\n",
    "- gridded (on a common timestep... usually hourly) moored timeseries data\n",
    "- gridded (in depth and time?) timeseriesprofile data (1m and 1hr?)\n",
    "- gridded (in depth and time?) TrajectoryProfile data (1m)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Standard QC_\n",
    "- baseline corrections to collocated field characterizations / calibrations\n",
    "- application of most relevant calibration equations\n",
    "- removal of spikes and singleton outliers (manual edits to a csv file or - see [EcoFOCIpy_1d_filter_example.ipynb](EcoFOCIpy_1d_filter_example.ipynb) for other options)\n",
    "- removal of known periods of non-ideal operation (engineering issues, contamination, etc... usually from logs and notes)\n",
    "- secondary characterization and correction equations"

Where possible, use vendor software or vendor equations as these are normally well documented (or at least point to a source reference for the equations)."
